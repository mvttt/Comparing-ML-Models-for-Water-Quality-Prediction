# Comparing-ML-Models-for-Water-Quality-Prediction
Source code for comparing the performance of Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models in classifying water quality. The project involves preprocessing water quality datasets, training classification models, and evaluating their accuracy and performance.

## üß∞ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features
- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Training and testing of 3 classification models
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
- Visual comparison of model performance
